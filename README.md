# Claude François Forever Streaming

This project is a small proof‑of‑concept for uploading and streaming your own shows using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

Uploaded videos are stored in `public/uploads/`. The folder contains a `.gitkeep` file so it is tracked while ignoring uploaded media.
